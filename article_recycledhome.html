      <h3>Your New &quot;Recycled&quot; Home</h3>
	<h5>By Mike Hickman</h5>
	<p> <img src="images/MikeHickman.jpg" class="picture" width="100" height="135" alt="Mike Hickman - Polk County, FL Go Green Builder" align="left"/>Like uncut jewels mined from the earth, our neighborhood curbsides boost little yellow and blue bins filled with plastic bottles; bottles that can actually help make a &quot;gem&quot; of a new home.</p>
	<p>For an explanation, look no further than the &quot;Go Green&quot; Showcase Home, built by Hickman Homes. This home demonstrates cutting edge green technology, energy efficiency and recycled products.</p>
	<p> To start with, the home is at the forefront of recycling. A typical home of this size will create about 60 cubic yards of waste during construction; waste material that goes directly to a landfill. Through a simple program created by Florida Refuse, we were able to separate our debris and save about one-third of the material for reuse. </p>
	<p>Then, we searched for ways to incorporate recycled products in the home. Products that you can feel, touch, and appreciate the recycling efforts. Products that make a comfortable home to live in and produce less waste. We started from the ground up, building the foundation and walls with GreenBlok Produced by Cement Products of Lakeland. GreenBlok is a mix of locally processed material and recycled concrete. This block is as strong and as durable as a standard block.</p>
	<p> And if recycled walls don't excite you, how about dazzling countertops in the kitchen and baths? Made of 100% recycled glass fragments and concrete &quot;IceStone&quot; countertops offer a durable radiance unlike any other countertop material. </p>
	<p>So where do the plastic bottles fit in? How about carpet - made oul of recycled plastic bottles. Mohawk Industries, the carpet manufacturer, takes discarded bottles and shreds them in to plastic fibers. These fibers make up a soft-to-the-touch carpet with exceptional stain resistance, superb color clarity and at a cost the same as conventional carpets. The carpet has been so successful that Mohawk Industries now recycles more than three billion plastic bottles a year. </p>
	<p>For the &quot;Go Green&quot; Showcase Home, Mohawk has offered to give us the carpet if we collect an equivalent number of bottles needed to produce the carpet; 2,800 bottles to be exact. In response to this offer, the Polk County Builders Association and Stinson Carpets have established a collection center. So, if you want to see the direct results for your recycle efforts; give the Builders Association a call at 863-665-0844 or bring your bottles to the bright green dumpster located at Stinson Carpets, 2315 Commerce Drive, Lakeland. </p>
	<p>The &quot;Go Green&quot; Showcase Home, located at Morgan Creek Preserve in South Lakeland, is for sale. All of the proceeds will go to the Polk County Builders Association Foundation, a 501 (c)3, for the support of their Future Builders of America program and student scholarships. For additional information, contact the Polk County Builders Association at 863-665-0844 or Hickman Homes at 863-646-1166, or look us up at <a href="http://www.hickmanhomes.net">www.hickmanhomes.net</a>. </p>
	<p>Mike Hickman is President of Hickman Homes Inc. and the 2009 Chairman of the Future Builders of America.</p>
