      <h3>Your New &quot;Recycled&quot; Home</h3>
	<h5>By Mike Hickman</h5>
	<p> <img src="images/MikeHickman.jpg" class="picture" width="100" height="135" alt="Mike Hickman - Polk County, FL Go Green Builder" align="left"/>Imagine throwing a party at your home for 100 of your best friends, business associates and public officials. It is the middle of summer, 5 p.m., 95 degrees outside and you don’t have air conditioning. Crazy? Yes, but that is just what we did for our “Behind the Walls” reception at the Polk County Builders Association Foundation “go Green” Home.</p>
	
	<p>The unusual timing of this reception gave everyone an inside  look at all of the Green features that make this home unique. And, the fact  that everyone not only came, but stayed for the two hour reception, without air  condition, is a testimonial to how well the design and the products are working  to keep the home cool.<br />
	  </p>
	<p>On display were such things as the &ldquo;Icynene&rdquo; foam insulation  in the attic. Icycnene is an open cell, flexible foam that is sprayed on the  underside of the attic roof and walls. The foam will expand up to 100 times its  size, curing to a soft and flexible insulation that will seal the attic from  the summer heat or the winder cold. This foam looks like and acts like the  inside of your beverage cooler &hellip; without the liner.<br />
	  </p>
	<p>With the same idea in mind the exterior block walls were  filled with &ldquo;Foam Core&rdquo;, an expandable insulation pumped in to small holes  drilled around the home. Covering the inside of the Foam Core walls, we had an  &ldquo;M-shield&rdquo; reflective insulation. This product, in a striking blue color on the  inside, and shiny space age silver foil on the outside, acts to reflect heat  away from the iside of the home and back to the outside. This combination of  Foam Core and M-Shield gives us a dramatic R-15 value (heat resistance) for the  exterior wall.<br />
		</p>
	<p>Equally colorful, were the interior walls, sprayed green  with Bora-core termiticide. This environmentally friendly termite treatment  protects the home where it needs to and keeps harmful chemicals out of the  ground.<br />
	  </p>
	<p>Another chemical friendly product is the Uponor plumbing  supply lines in the home. The red and blue lines, respectively colored for the  hot and cold water that runs through them, are compression fit lines. That  means no toxic glues to work with or to be exposed to your drinking water.<br />
	  </p>
	<p>A less glamorous, but extremely important Green feature of  the home is the air conditioning system. The home is so energy efficient that  we were able to provide all of the air conditioning needs with a two-ton system  &ndash; less than half the size it would normally be. In fact, the home is so snug  that we have installed a dehumidifier and outside air exchanger to maximize the  efficiency and comfort of the home.<br />
	  </p>
	<p>These are just a few of the items featured &ldquo;behind the  walls&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Go Green&rdquo; home in future articles, I&rsquo;ll be talking about all of  the things, inside and out, that will make this home a very special place to  live.<br />
	  </p>
	<p>The &ldquo;Go Green&rdquo; Home, located at Morgan Creek Preserve in  South Lakeland, is for sale. All of the proceeds will go to the Polk County  Builders Association Foundation, a 501(c)3, for the support of their Future  Builders of America program and student scholarships. For additional  information about the Green features and our upcoming open house dates, contact  the Polk County Builders Association at 863-665-08744 or Hickman Homes at  863-646-1166, or look us up at <a href="http://www.hickmanhomes.net">www.hickmanhomes.net</a>.</p>
